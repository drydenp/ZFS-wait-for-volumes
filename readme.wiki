= ZFS wait for volumes =

Just a small thing to install a service that will wait for all z-volumes to actually be there ''before'' local-fs-pre is reached.

Ordinarily <tt>zfs-import-scan</tt> and <tt>zfs-import-cache</tt> are only imported by <tt>zfs-mount</tt> and <tt>zfs-mount</tt> is only ordered before <tt>local-fs.target</tt>, but the import does not have any ordering of its own with respect to <tt>local-fs-pre-target</tt>, so there is no guarantee that it has happened before that point.

This thing not only provides a choke point for operating on z-volumes (<tt>zfs-volumes.target</tt>) but also guarantees that the import happens before <tt>local-fs-pre</tt>, because <tt>zfs-volumes.target</tt> is also ordered before <tt>local-fs-pre</tt>.

=== Extract ===

This thing is actually an extract from another project that doesn't use systemd-cryptsetup-generator but the older <tt>cryptdisks</tt> to activate crypt volumes because I needed keyscripts.

Coincidentally I also think using choke points is better safety in volume activation than bare <tt>udev</tt> rules.

Another benefit of this is that <tt>zfs-import-scan</tt> and friends are actually ordered after <tt>cryptsetup.target</tt> which means you cannot normally activate any crypt devices after Z-volumes have shown up (after the initramfs), but since my thing currently does not use <tt>cryptsetup.target</tt> I escape that fate also.

In short, you can use this to encrypt Z-volumes if your pool is not activated in the initramfs.

This repository can also not actually accept pull requests, but that is beside the point here, I could also perform them in the master project if you would want.
